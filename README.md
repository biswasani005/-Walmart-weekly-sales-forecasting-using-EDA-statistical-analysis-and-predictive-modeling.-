![Project Banner](A_project_banner_features_a_capstone_project_title.png)

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting Walmart’s weekly sales data across U.S. retail outlets. The dataset contains **6,400+ records** with features such as holidays, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate.  

The goals of the project are:  
1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights, trends, and store performance.  
2. Build **predictive models** to forecast sales for the next 12 weeks at the store level.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Rows:** 6,435  
- **Columns:** 8  
- **Features:**  
  - `Store` → Store number  
  - `Date` → Week of sales  
  - `Weekly_Sales` → Sales for the given store in that week  
  - `Holiday_Flag` → Indicates if it’s a holiday week  
  - `Temperature` → Temperature during the sales week  
  - `Fuel_Price` → Regional fuel price  
  - `CPI` → Consumer Price Index  
  - `Unemployment` → Unemployment rate  

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed  
- Cleaned data, handled missing values and outliers  
- Studied correlations between sales and:  
  - **Unemployment rate** (impact on specific stores)  
  - **Holiday weeks** (seasonal sales trends)  
  - **Temperature fluctuations**  
  - **CPI changes**  
- Identified **top-performing** and **underperforming** stores  
- Measured sales gap between the best and worst performing outlets  

---

## 🤖 Modeling Approach  
- Applied **time series forecasting** and **regression models**  
- Forecasted **weekly sales for 12 future weeks** at the store level  
- Compared model performance based on accuracy and interpretability  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Holiday weeks significantly increase sales, especially around **Thanksgiving & Christmas**  
- Stores in high-unemployment regions show greater sales impact  
- **Temperature and CPI** influence sales differently across stores  
- Strong performance gap exists between the highest and lowest performing stores, highlighting optimization opportunities
